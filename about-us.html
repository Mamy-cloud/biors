                            application of statistical methods to industrial research, with

                <p>
                    Successful deliveries of analysis outputs for a clinical trial depends on a strong biostatistics team, 
                    which typically includes a study statistician and a programming team with several statistical 
                    programmers. As trials get more complex and biostatistics teams face increased pressure to produce 
                    outputs efficiently and on a timely basis, a strong working relationship between the study statistician 
                    and the programming team is vital to the success of the analysis project.
