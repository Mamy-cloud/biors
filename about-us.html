            <h1>Why us ?  </h1>
            <p>
                Successful deliveries of analysis outputs for a clinical trial depends on a strong biostatistics team, 
                which typically includes a study statistician and a programming team with several statistical 
                programmers. As trials get more complex and biostatistics teams face increased pressure to produce 
                outputs efficiently and on a timely basis, a strong working relationship between the study statistician 
                and the programming team is vital to the success of the analysis project.
